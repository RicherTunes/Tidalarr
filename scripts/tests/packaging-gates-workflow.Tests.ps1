.SYNOPSIS
    Phase 1 — TDD gate: .github/workflows/packaging-gates.yml must delegate to
    Common's reusable workflow and must pin that workflow to a specific commit SHA
    (not @main).

.DESCRIPTION
    Asserts three properties of the workflow file:
    1. The file exists.
    2. It contains a `uses:` reference to Common's reusable packaging-gates workflow.
    3. The SHA pin is present (i.e. the @ref is a 40-hex-character commit SHA, NOT "@main",
       "@master", or a semver tag without a SHA).
